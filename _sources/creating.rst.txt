Creating Phenopackets
=====================

Google's `Protocol Buffer (protobuf)  <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers>`_ framework automatically generates
Java code for building and working with Phenopackets. However, the code can be unwieldly. Additionally, many users
of the phenopacket framework will want to use a recommeded set of ontology terms for specific kinds of data, and thus
the phenopacket-tools library provides constants that are more convenient to use than manually creating the equilavent message.


Phenopacket-tools builder pattern
=================================

In this example, let's imagine we want to create a PhenotypicFeature element to denote that severe weakness of the
left triceps muscle was observed in a patient at the age of 11 years and 4 months. First, let us code this using
the Phenopacket code that is automatically generated by the protobuf framework.


.. code-block:: java

    OntologyClass tricepsWeakenss = OntologyClass.newBuilder()
                .setId("HP:0031108")
                .setLabel("Triceps weakness")
                .build();
    OntologyClass left = OntologyClass.newBuilder()
                .setId("HP:0012835")
                .setLabel("Left")
                .build();
    OntologyClass severe = OntologyClass.newBuilder()
                .setId("HP:0012828")
                .setLabel("Severe")
                .build();
    Age iso8601duration = Age.newBuilder().setIso8601Duration("P11Y4M").build();
    TimeElement ageElement = TimeElement.newBuilder().setAge(iso8601duration)
                .setAge(iso8601duration)
                .build();
    PhenotypicFeature pfeature = PhenotypicFeature.newBuilder()
                .setType(tricepsWeakenss)
                .setOnset(ageElement)
                .setSeverity(severe)
                .addModifiers(left)
                .build();

The following code block uses functions from the phenopacket-tools library to simplify the creation of this PhenotypicFeature element.

.. code-block:: java

    PhenotypicFeature pfeature2 = PhenotypicFeatureBuilder.builder("HP:0031108","Triceps weakness")
                .addModifier(severe())
                .addModifier(left())
                .onset(TimeElements.age("P11Y4M"))
                .build();

Both code snippets generate identical phenopacket code.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "type": {
            "id": "HP:0031108",
            "label": "Triceps weakness"
        },
        "severity": {
            "id": "HP:0012828",
            "label": "Severe"
        },
        "modifiers": [{
            "id": "HP:0012835",
            "label": "Left"
        }],
        "onset": {
            "age": {
                "iso8601duration": "P11Y4M"
            }
        }
    }
